# ASCII-Art
The ASCII Art Generator is a Python project that converts images into ASCII art. It takes an image as input, processes the pixel values, and maps them to ASCII characters using a gradient string. The resulting ASCII art representation is displayed in the console or on the screen. The project offers a creative and interactive way to generate unique visual representations of images using text-based characters.
